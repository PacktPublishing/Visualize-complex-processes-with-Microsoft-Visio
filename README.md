This is the code repository for [Visualize Complex Processes with Microsoft Visio](https://www.packtpub.com/product/visualize-complex-processes-with-microsoft-visio/9781837631926), published by Packt.

**A guide to visually creating, communicating, and collaborating business processes efficiently**

## What is this book about?
Every business has process flows, but not all of them are fully described to or verified for accuracy with each stakeholder. This not only presents a risk for business continuity but also removes the ability to make insightful improvements. To make these complex interactions easy to grasp, itâ€™s important to describe these processes visually using symbology that everybody understands. Different parts of these flows should be collaboratively developed and stored securely as commercial collateral.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Choose an appropriate flowchart diagram type to describe process steps
* Develop the skills to efficiently use Visio to draw process flowcharts
* Discover how to create process flows diagrams to meet the BPMN standard
* Find out how to synchronize Excel tables with Visio process flowcharts
* Store flowcharts that can also be used for collaboration securely
* Understand how to export flowcharts and data to other M365 apps
* Discover how Visio ShapeSheet functions can increase productivity
